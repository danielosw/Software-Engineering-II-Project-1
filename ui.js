AI USE (by RPM) — loss/win sequence, passing the grid, music stop, and restart button

How/why AI was used:
ChatGPT was used to merge the useful end-game behavior from the branch Chris worked on
with Ruben's presentation/music behavior and then debug the resulting loss
sequence.

Specific prompts entered:
1. "how do i make it cut off music"

2. "ask me questions to gauge what I'd want in the end"

3. After ChatGPT asked how the loss sequence should work, the requirements
   given were:
   "I'd say i'd want this: show the board for some time
   then fade to black, the words \"you just lost the game\" appears, and then
   restart button appears after. this is in sequence"
   The same response also specified revealing all mines, stopping music
   immediately, putting the restart button on the black screen, and keeping
   a restart button on a win.

4. "clicking on tiles does not immediately release hidden tiles, like
   sometimes it doesnt do anything, why is that"

5. "okay so now when i click on the bomb:
   - the black screen doesnt show up that I lost
   - the music did stop
   - the bomb did not get revealed
   - i was not prompted with restart button"

6. "how to make the black fade in on the game over"


Validation/revisions:
The original version supplied before these revisions was much simpler:
win_loss_continue() accepted only the result string, lose() called
resetScreen() and replaced the board with "You lose!", win() replaced it with
"You win!", and there was no restart button, no mine-reveal sequence, no music
shutdown, and no fade-to-black sequence.

The branch worked on by Chris before I merged already contained important pieces that were not generated
from scratch by ChatGPT: lose(grid) revealed the bombs, re-rendered the board,
disabled the buttons, and provided addRestartButton(). Ruben's branch already
contained the music/black-screen presentation work. ChatGPT's role here was to
help compare the two branches, combine the desired behavior, and adapt the
function interfaces so those pieces worked together.

Because the merged lose() needs the board itself, ChatGPT instructed changing
win_loss_continue(input) to win_loss_continue(input, grid), changing lose() to
lose(grid), and changing the render click-handler call from
win_loss_continue(result) to win_loss_continue(result, grid). This was not just
a style change: without the grid argument, lose(grid) reaches grid.flat() with
grid undefined. During testing, that exact mismatch produced the observed
behavior where the music stopped but the mines, black screen, and restart
button never appeared. The finalized file keeps the corrected grid parameter
through the entire call chain.

Another debugging pass found that setting bomb tiles to isFlipped = true was
not sufficient by itself. The earlier renderer only displayed
numSurroundingBombs for revealed tiles and had no branch for tile.isBomb.
ChatGPT therefore suggested adding an explicit tile.isBomb check in render()
and displaying "B". That render change is documented again at render() because
it is required for the "reveal every mine before fading" sequence to actually
be visible.

The fade itself was revised after the first implementation. ChatGPT originally
used one requestAnimationFrame(), but later recommended two nested
requestAnimationFrame() calls so the browser has a rendered frame at opacity 0
before transitioning to opacity 1. The finalized file uses that double-frame
approach and "opacity 1s ease".

The restart helper also changed after testing. ChatGPT first showed a plain
button and later explained how to add button.className = "restart-button".
When the class assignment was initially placed before const button =
document.createElement("button"), ChatGPT identified the ordering error and
moved the class assignment after button creation. The final file keeps that
correct order.

There are also two details in the finalized file that differ from earlier AI
suggestions and are intentionally documented rather than silently changed:
- An early music-stop answer suggested both currentMusic.pause() and
  currentMusic.currentTime = 0. The step-by-step version ultimately kept only
  pause(), and the finalized file still only pauses the track.
- The finalized lose() contains the opacity = "0" and transition assignment
  twice before the double requestAnimationFrame(). Those duplicate assignments
  are redundant and were not required by the AI solution, but they are
  preserved here because this documentation pass is not changing game logic.

Challenges/limitations:
The end-game behavior spans win_loss_continue(), lose(), win(),
addRestartButton(), render(), CSS, and the soundtrack state, so a problem in
one section can make the whole sequence appear broken.

AI-assisted section:
The later revisions involving currentMusic scope/use, win_loss_continue(...,
grid), lose(grid), the loss fade/timing sequence, win() restart behavior, and
addRestartButton().

AI USE (by RPM)— opening sequence, soundtrack state, and volume control

How/why AI was used:
ChatGPT was used for the opening presentation/soundtrack work and later for
debugging how that soundtrack interacts with the loss sequence.

Specific prompts available in the supplied history:
1. "how do i make it cut off music"
2. "first step be more specific, lets go one step at a time"

Validation/revisions:
The global declaration "let currentMusic;" was added later during the explicit
"how do i make it cut off music" debugging conversation. Originally,
currentMusic was declared inside the load callback, so lose() could not access
it. ChatGPT instructed moving the declaration outside the callback and changing
the inner initialization from "let currentMusic = main_theme" to
"currentMusic = main_theme". The final file follows that scoped-state revision.

Challenges/limitations:
Early in prompting, AI had declared that current music was not local, which caused issues whenever it was attempted to
have music audio be determined by a click of an icon in the bottom left.

AI-assisted section:
The opening intro/start trigger, soundtrack state and track handoff, volume
toggle behavior, and the currentMusic scope revision.

	AI USE (by RPM)— removing opening artwork/effects when START is pressed
	
	How/why AI was used:
	ChatGPT was used to make the presentation artwork disappear when the actual
	Minesweeper board starts.
	
	Specific prompts entered:
	1. "Now I want to make the page clipart disapear when the game starts"
	2. "It did not remove it..." followed by the selector that ended with
	   ".title-explosion .webpage_art"
	
	Validation/revisions:
	The first change added .webpage_art to the querySelectorAll() list that already
	hid the title, shadow, fire, and explosion elements. The first human attempt in the
	working file accidentally omitted the comma between ".title-explosion" and
	".webpage_art". This went unoticed and stunned me for some time as to why this wasn't behaving as it should.
	That selector means ".webpage_art inside .title-explosion",
	which did not match the standalone artwork, so the image remained visible.
	ChatGPT identified the selector mistake and the finalized file uses:
	".title, .title-shadow, .title-fire, .title-explosion, .webpage_art".

	
	Challenges/limitations:
	The bug was a CSS-selector syntax issue rather than a problem with
	element.style.display itself.

	Also, during separate merge advice, ChatGPT suggested stricter integer validation
	with Number.isInteger(Number(input.value)) and startup(Number(input.value)).
	The finalized file did NOT adopt those suggestions; it retains the earlier

AI USE (by RPM) — render() revisions for visible bombs, flag limiting, and flag counter

How/why AI was used:
ChatGPT was used to debug bomb visibility after a loss and to help transfer
the tested branch's flag-limit behavior into the finalized UI.

Specific prompts entered:
1. "okay so now when i click on the bomb:
   - the black screen doesnt show up that I lost
   - the music did stop
   - the bomb did not get revealed
   - i was not prompted with restart button"

2. "So a behavior on branch called \"tested' i want to implement is the Flag
   count, ensuring that the flag is limited to 10 and user knows how many
   flags there is. ... Point to me where he does this..."

3. "So walk me step by step in my ui.js to fix that"

4. "What I want to do is this:
   ---------------------------
   |   Flag-Icon  | Number  |
   |--------------------------
   I know that somewhere we have a icon that we use for tha flag, lets do that"

5. "cool, show me how to reposition it somewhere else on the screen"

Validation/revisions:
The bomb-display change was added specifically because the new lose(grid)
function marked bomb tiles as flipped and re-rendered the board, but the
pre-change renderer had no instructions for displaying a revealed bomb. It
only displayed tile.numSurroundingBombs. ChatGPT diagnosed that mismatch and
suggested an explicit tile.isBomb branch with button.textContent = "B". The
finalized renderer contains that branch, which is what makes the mine-reveal
portion of the loss sequence visible.

Challenges/limitations:
render() rebuilds the board after interactions, so the flag count is recomputed
each render rather than stored as a separate persistent counter.

Also, one merge recommendation from ChatGPT was NOT adopted in the finalized file:
during conflict review, ChatGPT recommended keeping tested's first-click mine
relocation improvements, including a stricter nonbombs filter and
setTileNeighboringBombCounts(grid). The finalized file still uses the earlier
filter "grid.flat(2).filter((tiler) => !tiler.isBomb)" and does not call
setTileNeighboringBombCounts(grid).

AI-assisted section:
The later tile.isBomb display branch, integration of the tested flag-limit
condition, and conversion of the existing text flag counter into the
flag-icon/number counter.
